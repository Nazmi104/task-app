Task-App is a robust, serverless task management system designed to handle task creation, queuing, and processing efficiently using modern cloud technologies. Built with Node.js and TypeScript, the application leverages AWS SQS, AWS Lambda, and containerization with Docker to provide a scalable, asynchronous, and serverless solution for managing tasks.

Features
Task Management: Create, queue, and process tasks seamlessly.
Serverless Architecture: Utilize AWS Lambda for efficient and cost-effective processing.
Message Queuing: Employ AWS SQS for asynchronous task communication.
Scalable Backend: Built with Node.js and TypeScript for performance and maintainability.
Containerized Deployment: Deploy using Docker for portability and scalability.
Cloud-Native: Fully integrated with AWS services for reliability and security.
Architecture
Node.js Backend:

Provides a RESTful API for task creation and management.
Integrates with AWS SQS for queuing tasks.
AWS SQS:

Acts as the message queue, storing tasks for asynchronous processing.
AWS Lambda:

Processes queued messages, enabling serverless task execution.
Docker:

Ensures consistent runtime environments for local development and production deployment.
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
TypeScript: Strongly typed programming language for better code quality and maintainability.
AWS SQS: Managed message queuing service for asynchronous communication.
AWS Lambda: Serverless compute service for executing backend logic.
Docker: Containerization platform for easy deployment.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nazmi104/task-app.git
cd task-app
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:

env
Copy code
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2
SQS_QUEUE_URL=https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/7654321098/TaskQueue
4. Run the Application Locally
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Access the API at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
1. Add a Task
Send a POST request to the /tasks endpoint using Postman or any HTTP client:

json
Copy code
{
  "taskName": "Example Task",
  "description": "This is a sample task."
}
2. View Logs
Check AWS CloudWatch logs for task processing via AWS Lambda.

Deployment
1. Dockerize the Application
Build and run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t task-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env task-app
2. Deploy to AWS ECS
Follow AWS ECS deployment instructions to host the Dockerized application in the cloud.

Future Improvements
Add user authentication and authorization.
Implement a web-based frontend for task management.
Integrate database support for persistent task storage.
Extend task processing with AWS Step Functions for complex workflows.
